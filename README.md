# Project Structure

This is a Next.js application for managing club activities, events, and members at an educational institution. The project uses a modern tech stack including GraphQL, Material-UI, and MDX for documentation.

## Root Directory Structure

```
.
├── public/          # Static assets and public resources
├── src/            # Application source code
├── dev.Dockerfile  # Development Docker configuration
├── Dockerfile      # Production Docker configuration
├── next.config.js  # Next.js configuration
└── package.json    # Project dependencies and scripts
```

## Core Directories

### Public (`/public`)
Contains static assets and resources:
- Institution and organization logos
- Carousel images for the homepage
- XML sitemaps for SEO
- Open Graph images for social media sharing

### Source (`/src`)
Main application code organized into several key directories:

#### Actions (`/actions`)
Server-side actions using Next.js Server Actions pattern:
- Club management (create, edit, delete)
- Event handling (creation, updates, reporting)
- Member management (approvals, rejections)
- File operations with secure signed URLs
- User data management
- Holiday scheduling

#### App (`/app`)
Next.js app router pages and layouts:
- Main layout and error handling (`layout.jsx`, `error.jsx`)
- Public pages (clubs, events, gallery)
- Management interfaces (`/manage`)
- User profiles and authentication
- Documentation system
- Calendar and scheduling interfaces

#### Components (`/components`)
Reusable React components:
- UI components (ActionPalette, ConfirmDialog, Toast)
- Feature-specific components for clubs, events, and members
- Theme customization (`ThemeRegistry`)
- Layout components (Footer, Layout)
- File handling (FileUpload, ImageModal)
- Custom SVG components and logos

#### Configuration and Utilities
- `acl/`: Access control and route protection
- `constants/`: Application-wide constants
- `contexts/`: React contexts for state management
- `gql/`: GraphQL queries and mutations
- `utils/`: Helper functions for formatting, auth, and file handling

## Key Features

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Protected routes and actions
   - User profile management

2. **Club Management**
   - Club creation and editing
   - Member management
   - Social media integration
   - Logo and banner handling

3. **Event System**
   - Event creation and scheduling
   - Approval workflows
   - Budget tracking
   - Report generation
   - Calendar integration

4. **Document Management**
   - MDX-based documentation
   - File upload and storage
   - Secure URL signing

5. **UI/UX Features**
   - Responsive design
   - Dark/light mode support
   - Image carousel
   - Loading states
   - Toast notifications

## Development Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router
- **API**: GraphQL with server actions
- **UI**: Material-UI with custom theme
- **Content**: MDX for documentation
- **Styling**: Emotion for CSS-in-JS
- **Docker**: Development and production configurations

## File Organization Patterns

- Feature-based organization
- Server actions for API operations
- Component co-location with related features
- Consistent file naming (`page.jsx`, `server_action.jsx`)
- Separation of UI components and server logic

## Getting Started

We use Docker to run the frontend but this is just the frontend microservice.

This should be usually run with the services as a whole, refer to the [`setup repo`](https://github.com/Clubs-Council-IIITH/setup) for running this locally.

## Notes

- The project uses Node.js module linking for optimized dependency management
- Includes SEO optimization with sitemaps and metadata
- Supports both development and production Docker environments
- Uses modern React patterns including Server Components and Actions
