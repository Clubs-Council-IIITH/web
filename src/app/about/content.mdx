### What do we do?

As a constituent body of the **Students' Life Committee (SLC)**, the Clubs Council oversees all the student-driven activities and the functioning of the clubs. It handles the annual budget of clubs, events, coordinates among different clubs and helps in creating new clubs, societies and special interest groups.

The Clubs Council works closely with the institute's Students' Life Office, Finance Council, Outreach, IT Offices, SLC and SAC faculty members, and all other student administrative bodies.

The primary aim of the Clubs Council is to ensure that all student-driven organizations on campus are successful in their aim to cultivate diverse campus life experiences throughout the year, and enrich the thriving campus community outside the classroom, while fostering inclusion.
